This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Zomato's dataset, aiming to uncover valuable insights and trends within the data. Through a structured approach, the analysis highlights the characteristics of the data, identifies missing information, explores the numerical and categorical variables, and investigates relationships between features.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA are:

- To clean and preprocess the data for effective analysis.
- To identify patterns and trends in the numerical and categorical features.
- To uncover meaningful relationships between variables that can inform future decision-making or modeling efforts.


## Steps Performed in the Analysis

1. Identifying Missing Values
- Conducted a thorough review of the dataset to identify missing or null values.
- Visualized missing values using heatmaps and other graphical techniques to highlight areas requiring attention.
- Applied appropriate strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation or removal, depending on their nature and significance.

2. Analysis of Numerical Variables
- Explored numerical features to understand their statistical properties, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).


3. Examination of Categorical Variables
- Analyzed the unique values and frequency distributions of categorical features.
- Created visualizations such as bar charts and count plots to represent the distribution of categorical data.


4. Exploring Feature Relationships
- Highlighted key insights, such as the influence of certain features on others.
